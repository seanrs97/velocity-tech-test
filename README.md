Velocity tech test

### Notes

    - I've included notes and comments across this task where possible.
    - This is to help understand what certain pieces of code have been created for as well as the reasoning behind creating the code the way it has been.
    - Some parts of this task have not been developed fully due to time restrictions.

    - For the cart drawer, I have hardcoded products instead of cart items as I ran out of time to create functionality to add items to the cart.
    - Certain JS functionality has not been created yet, such as clearing the cart, adding item to the wishlist and removing an item from the cart.
    - The footer has been left out due to time restrictions
